function getConcatenation(numbers) {
  // Concatenate the input array with itself using the concat method.
  return numbers.concat(numbers);
}

/*

The time complexity of this function depends on the length of the input array, numbers. 

The concat method creates a new array by iterating over the elements of the original array and appending them to the new array. 

Since it needs to process all elements of the array once, the time complexity is linear, denoted as O(n), where n is the length of the array.

The concat method creates a new array that combines the elements of the original array with the elements of the concatenated array. 

In this case, since we are concatenating the array with itself, the resulting concatenated array will have twice the length of the original array. 

Therefore, the space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
